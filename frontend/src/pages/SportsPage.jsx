                  Playing for the Dallas Cowboys comes with heightened
                  expectations, being under the microscope of the national media
                  and drawing the ire of opposing fans due to how large the
                  brand of “America’s Team” is. For Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon
                  Diggs, that pressure doesn’t faze him.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Diggs put together a dominant 2021 campaign that saw him
                  record 11 interceptions, the most in a single season since
                  Champ Bailey tallied 10 in the 2006 NFL season. With a
                  historic season in 2021 comes more eyes in 2022 and people are
                  ready to see whether he can duplicate a record-setting year.
                  Even with his numbers in 2021, there was some criticism for
                  Diggs on his ability to cover but Diggs will not even
                  entertain that banter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I don’t pay them any attention,” Diggs says. “They don’t know
                  what they are talking about. Literally, what are you talking
                  about?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regardless of the outcome this season, the Cowboys crown jewel
                  of their secondary appears ready for whatever comes his
                  way.&nbsp;He is trusting the work and preparation in the
                  offseason will continue to push him up the list of elite
                  cornerbacks in the NFL. In an interview with Complex for his
                  recent collaboration with LIDS, Diggs discussed his success in
                  the league thus far, tuning out the noise of his naysayers,
                  his relationship with All-Pro sibling Stefon Diggs, as well as
                  what he looks for in a dominant cornerback and more.
